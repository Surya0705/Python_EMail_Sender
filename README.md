# Python_EMail_Sender
This is a Python Program that can send simple Text Mails to anyone you want. It uses a Python Module that is SMTPLIB. In my case it was in-built. Also as Mentioned in the [Main.py](Main.py) file, here I will tell you how to get App Password for SMTP. Just follow the instructions below:
1. Go to [My Accounts Site](https://myaccount.google.com/) and Click on Settings.
